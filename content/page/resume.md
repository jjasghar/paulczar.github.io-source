## Overview

I am an experienced hands-on Architecht / DevOps Engineer with a long history in Operations and Infrastructure Automation.  I have a broad depth of experience across most IT and Operations related areas with strong experience in using and evangelizing DevOps tools and methodologies.

My current role at IBM has me focussed on helping to rebuild the IBM developer advocacy programs and content creation processes.  Previous to that I led the conversion of our OpenStack Automation platform ([ursula](https://github.com/blueboxgroup/ursula)) from just Ubuntu to also supporting Redhat Enterprise Linux.  I also architected and built (and later led a small agile team) the Blue Box Cloud SRE Operations Platform (which we recently opensourced as [cuttle](https://github.com/IBM/cuttle)).

Previous to IBM/Blue Box I was at Rackspace where I worked on a team building a product with Docker on top of Openstack, and before that I worked at EA where I helped build and design the infrastructure for SimCity ( on AWS ) and SWTOR ( own datacenters, approx 6,000 servers, 2M+ subscribers at launch ).

## Passion Projects

Over Christmas 2014 I built out [Factorish](https://github.com/factorish/factorish) as a concept to show managing the lifecycle and configuration of applications in Docker using service discovery, and built several example apps such as [Percona with Galera Replication](https://github.com/paulczar/docker-percona_galera) and the [ELK stack](https://github.com/factorish/factorish-elk).  Concepts with have found their way into tools such as [Container Pilot](https://github.com/joyent/containerpilot) and [Habitat.sh](https://habitat.sh).  I also used it as a basis for a [blog post](http://tech.paulcz.net/blog/factorish_and_the_12_fakter_app/) and a series of talks I gave on Dockerizing apps that really shouldn’t be Dockerized.

Built out a Chef Inspec Repository for [RedHat 6 STIG auditing](https://github.com/inspec-stigs/inspec-stig-rhel6) and formed a small community around using [Inspec for STIG auditing](https://github.com/inspec-stigs).

## Professional Accomplishments

### IBM / Blue Box

* Led the effort to port the Blue Box OpenStack automation tool ([ursula](https://github.com/blueboxgroup/ursula)) to support RedHat Enterprise Linux as well as Ubuntu ([see](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/04/ibm-bluemix-private-cloud-red-hat/)), with full STIG compliance and Chef Inspec for auditing.

* Recognised the need for a unified SRE Operations Platform to support growth and built SiteController ([cuttle](https://github.com/IBM/cuttle)) and architecuted and built it, later forming and leading a team to maintain and develop it further.

* Successfully led the effort to make Blue Box OpenStack installable in customer datacenter with no internet access utilizing SiteController and overhauling large parts or Ursula.

### Rackspace

* Built the initial Build/Push/Run workflow for the [now mostly defunct] OpenStack PaaS project (Solum) utilizing Docker and the Cedarish style workflow demonstrated by Dokku and DEIS.

* Worked on the OpenStack nova-docker driver, and was the first [known] person to successfully run [OpenStack in docker](https://github.com/paulczar/dockenstack) containers.

* Maintained Community Chef Cookbooks for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.

### BioWare – Star Wars The Old Republic (SWTOR)

* Supported the studio during development.   Lead the Online Operations team through purchasing and deploying over 6,000 servers in four datacenters to run the online environment. Ensured a successful and glitch free  launch of SWTOR on the 20th December 2011.

* Built a large cluster of Xen Hypervisors to provide virtual game servers for development and wrote scripts for deploying game databases from SAN snapshots ( reducing storage requirements from 36Tb to less than 1Tb ).   

* Successfully deployed a proof of concept private cloud with CloudStack to further increase our Virtualization abilities and create a self-service portal for our developers.
