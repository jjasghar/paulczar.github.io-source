    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lately I've been doing a lot of prototyping with <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>, specifically for a couple of distinct activities:-</p>

<ul>
<li>building puppet modules using <a href="https://github.com/elasticdog/puppet-sandbox">the excellent puppet sandbox</a> project</li>
<li>and building RPM packages with <a href="https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm">FPM</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>I realized I was spending a bunch of time flipping back and forth between Vagrant environments and I had no quick way to utilize RPMs built with FPM inside my puppet modules.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>An idea was born.   I forked off the <a href="https://github.com/paulczar/puppet-sandbox">puppet sandbox</a> project and added a Yum repo module <code>repository</code> to the standalone puppet provisioner that vagrant uses when it first brings up a box.   It adds a Yum repo on the puppet server called <code>sandbox</code> and adds a repo file to the client boxes pointing to the repo.   Now I can simply push an RPM to <code>packages/rpm</code> and run <code>vagrant provision puppet</code> which reruns puppet and rebuilds the yum repo.</p>

<p>Given that I often flip back and forth between Ubuntu and CentOS boxes I also created <code>Vagrantfile.centos63</code> and <code>Vagrantfile.precise64</code> so I can swiftly destroy the existing environment and bring up another of a different flavour by simply symlinking <code>Vagrantfile</code> to the appropriate file.</p>

<p>This worked out pretty well for a while until I realized I was still jumping back and forth between vagrant environments and I realized I had another improvement to make.   So I then went on to create a definition in the puppet sandbox <code>Vagrantfile</code> file for a <code>FPM server</code> and a new module in the provisioner to install FPM on it.   Given that this module simply adds a few packages this module works for both CentOS and Ubuntu.</p>

<p>I also created a couple of sample scripts to download source and build RPMs for both Redis and Elasticsearch which get pushed via the provisioner to <code>/tmp/redis-rpm.sh</code> and <code>/tmp/elasticsearch-rpm.sh</code></p>

<p>Now ( For CentOS boxes at least ) I can very quickly iterate on puppet modules and create RPM packages on the fly and have them instantly available.   The process is very simple and looks a little something like this :</p>

<p><code>
$ git clone https://github.com/paulczar/puppet-sandbox
$ cd puppet-sandbox
$ vagrant up puppet fpm client1
$ vagrant ssh fpm
[vagrant@fpm ~]$ sudo /tmp/redis-rpm.sh
  ...
  ... A bunch of scrolling text while files are downloaded and rpm is built
  ...
[vagrant@fpm ~]$ exit
$ vagrant provision puppet
$ vagrant ssh client1
[vagrant@client1 ~]$ sudo yum clean all
[vagrant@client1 ~]$ sudo yum -y install redis
[vagrant@client1 ~]$ sudo service redis-server start
[vagrant@client1 ~]$ redis-cli ping
PONG
[vagrant@client1 ~]$
</code></p>

<p>If I'm building a puppet module that needs redis I can now add the following to it's init.pp ( or more properly create a module for redis and request it from the module I'm building )</p>

<p>```
  package { 'redis':</p>

<pre><code>ensure =&gt; 'present';
</code></pre>

<p>  }
```</p>

<p>Of course Debian/Ubuntu doesn't use Yum/RPM for package management.    I'd love to accept a pull request from somebody who wants to extend it to also support a local APT repository.   I left breadcrumbs in the <code>repository</code> module for some appropriate classes to be spliced in...</p>
